<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Well, I created this page because I really liked this anime, 
  so I&apos;ll share a little bit of my opinion about the anime 
  with you. The anime has a great animation, design and story, 
  what impacted me the most in the story was the mystery of why 
  cosette became an unprepared musicart and why it consumes the 
  conductor&apos;s life to use his skills, this part of consuming 
  the conductor&apos;s life has a lot to do with the appearance of 
  it containing roses and their thorns, the takt gains superhuman 
  strength when it activates the powers of musicart and conductor, 
  which is not normal to happen so I didn&apos;t quite understand why still.

  This anime managed to develop the characters&apos; story in 12 episodes it 
  seems rushed, but it seems incredible, it has a good character development, 
  especially the evolution of destiny experiencing human feelings, it was also 
  amazing to see the story of lenny and titan and how they if they knew the 
  evolution of titan was something incredible.

  I imagine the chances of having a second season are pretty big because I hit 
  a score of more than 7 out of 10, and there&apos;s still a lot of story to go, 
  so the chances of having a second season are pretty big in the next few years, 
  too. being developed an anime game that if it has a good pre-registration adhesion 
  will contribute to the chances of a second anime season.

  And so I liked the anime? Yes and I highly recommend it, it seems a lot like you are 
  seeing a musical fix, the feeling that this anime gives is incredible, I would give it 
  a 9, my rating is 9 because the story is not fully developed yet so let&apos;s hope for a 
  second season.

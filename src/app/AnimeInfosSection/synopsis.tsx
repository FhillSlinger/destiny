        The United States of America has been in chaos ever since 
        the emergence of D2s, an invasive species originating from 
        a black meteorite that fell to Earth. A public decree banned 
        citizens from playing any melodies, to prevent further 
        casualties caused by the D2s is hatred for music—even now, 
        in 2047, this prohibition is still in effect. Humanity is 
        only form of defense against the D2s are Musicarts, young 
        women representing pieces of classical music; and Conductors, 
        the ones controlling them.
